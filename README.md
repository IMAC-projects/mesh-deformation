# Deforming meshes by reinforcement learning

This repository is based on [3DModelingRL](https://github.com/clinplayer/3DModelingRL) that is the source code for the ECCV 2020 paper [Modeling 3D Shapes by Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12397).

## How to install Pytorch3D ?

Everything is explained in the [README](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d/blob/master/INSTALL.md) of the pytorch3D lib.

The following command are for my GC only with CUDA 11.2

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/NVIDIA/cub/archive/1.11.0.tar.gz
tar xzf 1.11.0.tar.gz
export CUB_HOME=$PWD/cub-1.11.0
```

I installed Pytorch3D, with the following command :

```python
git clone "https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d.git"
cd pytorch3d
pip install -e .
```

## Aim of this project

Our aim is to transform a 3D model (mesh) with deep learning in order to apply an artistic style to it after processing.

**Input:**
Primitive-based shape representation of our wanted model (box)

**Method:** 
Supervised with examples of transformations (box input => 3d mesh output)

**Output:**
3D model (mesh)
